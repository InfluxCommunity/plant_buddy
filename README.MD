# Plant Buddy with Dash

This demo is based of the [Plant Buddy IoT project](https://github.com/rickspencer3/plant-buddy) created by Rick Spencer. 

The goal:
This demo shows how InfluxDB can be successfully used as a storage backend for a Flask server. Leverage Flux queries to filter and retrive your IoT data and then use Dash plotly to visualise. The below BPMN outlines the overall architecture and data flow:
