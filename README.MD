# Plant Buddy with Dash

This demo is based of the [Plant Buddy IoT project](https://github.com/rickspencer3/plant-buddy) created by Rick Spencer. 

The goal:
This demo shows how InfluxDB can be successfully used a storage backend for a Flask server. In this demo we show how you can leverage Flux queries to filter and retrive your IoT data. Then use Dash plotly to visualise the data.
